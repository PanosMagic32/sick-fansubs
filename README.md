### Development server

Run `pnpm run dev` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

It is recommended to use the Nx console VSCode plugin to generate whatever you want as a library in the libs folder. Right click on the path you want and select `ng generate`. Then follow the on-screen instructions.

### Build

Run `pnpm run build:all` to build the projects (both `api` and `sick-fansubs`) for production. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. You can build an individual project with `nx build {{app-name}}` and you can use the `--prod` flag for a production build, like `nx build {{app-name}} --prod`.

### Understand your workspace

Run `nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.
